# Ontario 
If you wish to immigrate to Ontario, then you have three categories of immigration streams to choose from:

-   Express Entry streams;
-   Masters or PhD streams; and/or
-   Employer Job Offer streams.

Ontario’s Express Entry streams are for skilled workers, French-speaking skilled workers, and tradespersons. These streams operate through Canada’s federal Express Entry  system. Only candidates with a valid Express Entry profile are eligible to receive a Notification of Interest (NOI) from the OINP through these streams.

Masters and PhD Graduate streams are for international graduates from an Ontario university with a masters or PhD degree. No job offer is required to apply through this category.

Lastly, job offer streams are for candidates who have an eligible job offer in Ontario from an employer who is willing to nominate them.

### **Common** additional eligibility criteria
The following additional eligibility criteria is present for most streams of the OINP. These criteria below are fully explained in this section and are referenced multiple times as criteria for different streams.

**Valid licensing and certification (if applicable)**
If a candidate’s work experience is in a compulsory trade, (even if this only part of the work experience, and a candidate no longer works in this role), they must prove that they held, (and/or are currently holding) a valid authorization or license from a recognized Ontario regulatory body.

**Current residence and legal status in Ontario**
If you are applying from within Canada, you must hold a valid status (such as a visitor record, study permit, or work permit) at the time of your application and maintain this status until you receive a nomination. Some streams are open to eligible candidates both inside and outside of Canada.

You may also apply if you are in ‘maintained status’ when submitting your OINP application. ‘Maintained status’ occurs when you have submitted a request to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to renew or extend your temporary status document (like a visitor record, work permit, or study permit) before its expiration. This status allows you to stay in Canada and continue working or studying under the same conditions as your existing permit until a decision is made on your pending IRCC application.

**Intention to live in Ontario**
Candidates in this stream must plan to live in Ontario after being granted permanent residence. This intention is determined by evaluating their connections to Ontario, which may include:
-   Working or having worked in Ontario;
-   Receiving job offers or applying/interviewing for jobs;
-   Studying;
-   Volunteering;
-   Leasing or owning property;
-   Visiting; and/or
-   Having professional networks, affiliations, family ties, and personal relationships.

**Settlement funds**
Candidates must have sufficient funds to support themselves and their dependent family members when settling in Canada.

-   Annual earnings from ongoing employment in Ontario; and/or
-   A job offer in Ontario.

**Language test**
To prove their proficiency in English and/or French, candidates must take a langauge test from an authorized testing agency. The test date must be within two years prior to the application submission date.

For English tests, the following are accepted:

## Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream
OINP’s Express Entry aligned Human Capital Priorities stream is designed to give foreign workers with eligible work experience, language abilities, and education, a pathway to live and work permanently in Ontario.

Candidates within this stream must have a valid profile in IRCC’s federal  Express Entry  candidate pool and receive a Notification of Interest (NOI) from the OINP, before they can apply online to be nominated for  permanent residence (PR) by the province.

If you receive a nomination through Ontario Express Entry, you will be notified. It will then be up to you, the candidate, to accept or refuse the nomination. Accepting the nomination awards you with an extra 600 CRS points. This means that you will receive an  Invitation to Apply (ITA) in the next all-program Express Entry draw.  

**Minimum Requirements:**  
The following are the minimum requirements needed to be eligible through one of the streams under the Human Capital Category:
-   Must have enough money to support yourself and your family.
-   Must intend to live in Ontario
Candidates in the Human Capital Priorities stream can choose to have their work experience assessed against criteria of the FSWP, or the CEC program (both under the federal Express Entry system).

While the two programs feature slightly different work experience criteria under both candidates must:
-   Obtain work experience of at least one year, while meeting requirements for  full-time work, or  equivalent part-time work
-   Obtain work experience only after receiving a license or other authorization to perform their job in Ontario (if needed). Work experience obtained before proper licensing or authorization will not be considered eligible under this stream.

In addition to the above criteria, candidates must also show:
-   Valid licensing (if needed for work experience);
-   Sufficient settlement funds relevant to their situations;
-   Intention to live in Ontario; and
-   Legal status in Canada (if applying from within the country).
