## PEI Immigration Categories

If you wish to immigrate to PEI, then you have three options to choose from:
-   PEI PNP Express Entry;
-   Labour Impact Category;
-   Business Impact Category.

The PEI PNP Express Entry is for candidates who have a valid Express Entry profile, wish to live and work in Prince Edward Island, and have skills that match current identified labour market needs in the province.
The Labour Impact Category is for skilled workers and international graduates who have the skills and experience needed in PEIâ€™s labour market. This category is divided into three streams:

-   Skilled Worker Stream;
-   Critical Worker Stream;
-   International Graduate Stream.

The Business Impact Category is for people who want to invest in a PEI business. It allows you to live in PEI on a work permit to learn about the business you are investing in before receiving a provincial nomination.  

## PEI PNP Express Entry

**Needs job offer?** No

**Application Fee:** CAD $300

**Processing time:** 6 months

****Minimum** Requirements:**

-   Must have an Express Entry profile;
-   Must be eligible for one of the three main federal economic class immigration programs: Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) or the Canadian Experience Class (CEC).

If you are a Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) holder or a spousal open work permit holder:

-   Your PGWP must have at least four months validity at the time you submit your EOI;
-   Must have studied outside of PEI (or be a spouse to someone who studied outside PEI);
-   Must have at least nine months of work experience under a PEI employer.

**How it works:**
If you are satisfied that you meet the minimum requirements, the first step to apply for the PEI PNP Express Entry is to create a profile in the Prince Edward Island Expression of Interest (EOI) system.

When creating a profile, you will be asked multiple questions for which you must provide the correct information. You are able to come back and change the information provided at any time.

Based on the information you provide in the EOI, you will be given a point score according to the  selection system points grid. You can score a maximum of 100 points.

During regular draws, the province invites the highest-scoring candidates to apply for a provincial nomination. You will receive an email notification if you are invited.

You will be required to complete the application forms and your employer must also complete the employer forms. Submit your application within 60 days.

If successful, you will receive a provincial nomination. You must accept the nomination through your Express Entry account. You are likely going to receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence in the next Express Entry draw.
