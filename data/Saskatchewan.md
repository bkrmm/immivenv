# Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP)


Saskatchewan has an enhanced sub-category , and many base sub-categories. The enhanced sub-category is called Saskatchewan Express Entry , and is
under the International Skilled W orker Category .
Enhanced means that the sub-category is aligned with the Express Entry  system, which is the system that the federal government uses to manage
permanent residence applications through the country’ s three main economic class immigration programs.
The Express Entry system gives a candidate a point score based on the Comprehensive Ranking System  (CRS). The highest-ranking candidates are
invited to apply for permanent residence during an Express Entry draw .
If you get a nomination from an enhanced provincial program, you get an extra 600 CRS points, practically guaranteeing getting an Invitation to Apply  (ITA)
for permanent residence. You also get your nomination through your Express Entry profile.
The majority of Saskatchewan’ s sub-categories are base streams. This means that they are not aligned with the Express Entry system. Candidates who
get a provincial nomination are required to apply directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada  (IRCC).

How it works:
Saskatchewan uses an Expression of Interest (EOI) for the Express Entry and Occupations In-Demand sub-categories.
You must first register your EOI on the SINP  Apply Online portal , where you will be asked to fill out a form. Answers on the form will be used to assess your
eligibility .
To enter the EOI pool, you must score a minimum of 60 out of 1 10 points in the EOI Points Grid. The EOI Points Grid assesses you based on five factors:
education and training, skilled work experience, language ability , age and connections to the Saskatchewan labour market and adaptability .
If you’re selected, you will receive an invitation to apply during an EOI draw .
At this point, you can apply for a provincial nomination from the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP). You can do this through the same
portal.
If you have a job of fer and you’re applying through the Employment Of fer sub-category , you can apply directly without needing to register an EOI.
After your application is approved, you can then apply for permanent residence directly to IRCC. If you’re applying through the Express Entry sub-category ,
Saskatchewan will enter the details of your nomination into the system. This means you will get an extra 600 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)
points, which will ef fectively guarantee receiving an invitation to apply for permanent residence in the next Express Entry draw .
