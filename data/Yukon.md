## Yukon Immigration Categories:

If you wish to immigrate to Yukon, then you can choose from the following five options:

-   Yukon Express Entry (YEE)
-   Skilled Worker
-   Critical Impact Worker
-   Business Nominee
-   Yukon Community Pilot.

The  **Yukon Express Entry (YEE)**  program is for foreign skilled workers who have a valid job offer for permanent, full-time work in Yukon. Employers in the territory who cannot find Canadian citizens or permanent residents to fill job openings have access to the Express Entry pool of candidates.

The  **Skilled Worker**  program are for foreign skilled workers who are sponsored by a Yukon employer for Canadian permanent residence. You must be working in a National Occupational Classification (NOC) Skill Level 0, A or B job.

The  **Critical Impact Worker**  program is for semi-skilled or unskilled workers who work in an occupation that is in high demand in the territory, and who are sponsored by an employer. You must therefore have a valid job offer from a Yukon employer. However, you do not need to be in Yukon when you apply.

The  **Business Nominee**  program is for those with proven business experience who wish to start a new business, partner with an existing business or purchase and operate an existing business in Yukon. You should be ready to make a significant investment in your Yukon-based business.

The  **Yukon Community Pilot**  allows those who are already nominated to get a special type of work permit that lets them work for multiple employers in one of the participating Yukon communities. This pilot project is scheduled to run from January 2020 to June 2023.

## Yukon Express Entry
**Needs job offer?** Yes  
**Processing Time:** 12-14 weeks
**Minimum Requirements:**
-   Must meet the requirements of one of Canada’s three  economic immigration programs;
-   Must have an Express Entry profile;
-   Must have enough money to support yourself and your family members in Canada;
-   Must have a valid full-time, permanent job offer from a Yukon employer;
-   Must intend to live and work in Yukon.

**How it works:**
The first step is for you to receive a job offer from a Yukon employer. The employer must first demonstrate that there is no Canadian citizen or permanent resident available.

The next step is for you to prove that you have enough money to settle in Canada.

You then complete and submit the Yukon Express Entry application form alongside your employer.

IRCC will then provide you with an Invitation to Apply, after which you will have to provide all the required documents to complete your application for permanent residence.

After IRCC and Yukon’s Immigration Unit verify your documents, you will receive your permanent residence.


## Yukon Skilled Worker Program
**Needs job offer?** Yes  
**Processing Time:** 12-14 weeks
**Minimum Requirements:**
-   Must have the education and work experience required for the job (minimum high school diploma);
-   Must have at least one year of work experience for the position;
-   Must have a valid work permit if the applicant is in Canada;
-   Must have a valid job offer;
-   Must meet minimum language requirements;
-   Employer must meet additional requirement;

**How it works:**
The first step is for the employer to advertise the position locally and nationally in Canada to make sure that no Canadian citizen or permanent resident is currently available for the role.

Next, the employer would extend the job offer to you. The job must be full-time and permanent.

You and your employer will then have to complete all the required forms, and then the employer submits the complete application to Yukon.

If the employer is approved by the Yukon Nominee Program, your information will then be reviewed.

If you are approved, you will become nominated by the territory. You can then use your nomination to apply for a Temporary Work Permit from IRCC, as well as an application for permanent residence.

You can then use the work permit to work in Yukon while your permanent residence application is being processed. Once you meet security, health and criminality checks, you will become a permanent resident of Canada.  

  

## Yukon Critical Impact Worker Program

**Needs job offer?** Yes  
**Processing Time:** 12-14 weeks
**Minimum Requirements:**
-   Must have a permanent full-time job offer;

-   Must have at least six months of related work experience;
-   Must have a valid work permit if you are in Canada;
-   Must meet the minimum language requirement in English or French;
-   Employer must also meet additional requirements.

**How it works:**
First, you must receive a job offer from a Yukon employer.

The employer must have first advertised the position and shown that there is no Canadian citizen or permanent resident available for it.

The next step is for you and your employer to complete the required forms. Your employer must then submit the application to the YNP.

If the employer is approved, the YNP will then review your information.

If you are approved, you will become nominated by the Yukon territory. You can then apply for a temporary work permit as well as an application for permanent residence, both from IRCC.

Once you get your work permit, you can travel to Canada and work in Yukon with your work permit while you wait for your permanent residence application to be processed.

You must first make sure that you are eligible to immigrate to Yukon. Then, submit your application on the  Yukon website.

After you receive approval in principle, you will be required to submit a Business Plan, that includes an outline of how you will establish a successful business.

At this point, you will have to demonstrate the CAD $300,000 investment in the business, and at least one-third ownership.

You can then apply for a temporary work permit, with which you can travel to Yukon and start your business.

When you arrive in Yukon, you will have to meet with a Yukon Business Nominee Program (YBNP) representative.

You will also need to meet additional requirements for the first year in Yukon as a nominee, and for the second year in Yukon as a nominee.

If you meet all requirements during your two year work period, you will get support by the YBNP in your application to the Canadian federal government for permanent residence.

You must make sure that you hold a valid work permit until you get permanent residence status in Yukon.  

  

## Yukon Community Pilot

If you are provincially nominated, the Yukon Community Pilot can help you get a special work permit that would allow you to work for multiple employers in one of the participating Yukon communities.

This pilot program is scheduled to run between January 2020 and June 2023.

**Minimum Requirements:**
-   Must be nominated by the territory;
-   Must have 2 or 3 eligible job offers, all of which are in the same participating Yukon community;
-   Must have a signed letter of support from the Yukon government;
-   Must meet requirements for the work permit.

In addition, your jobs must add up to at least 30 hours of work per week. They must be non-seasonal, and the wage must meet or exceed the minimum wage.

Your work experience must show that you can perform the duties of the jobs offered.

**How it works:**
You must first make sure that you have been nominated by the territory of Yukon for permanent residence.

In addition, you must get a signed letter of support from the Yukon government. The letter must say that the employer who are offering the jobs need you to work in the community as soon as possible and that the job offers are real. The letter must also include details of the job offers such as the names of the employers, the occupation, the number of hours per week and the job locations.

As part of your application, you will need to submit this signed letter, as well as a copy of the nomination letter from the Government of Yukon.

Once you’re ready, you must apply online on the federal Canadian government website. The application form depends on where you are applying from.

Getting this work permit lets you work for up to three different employers in one of the participating Yukon communities.

The work permit would be valid for 2 years. The employer will not need a Labour Market Impact Assessment.

**Participating communities:**
-   Whitehorse;
-   Watson Lake;
-   Dawson City;
-   Haines Junction;
-   Carmacks;
-   Carcross.
