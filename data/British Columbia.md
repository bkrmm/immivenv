## Program overview

The BC PNP offers two main immigration pathways: Skills Immigration and Entrepreneur Immigration.

Skills Immigration is for workers and recent graduates who meet specific eligibility criteria based on job offer and education, among others. Entrepreneur Immigration is for experienced entrepreneurs and businesses that can contribute to the province’s economy by establishing and managing a business in B.C.

## Program initiatives

As B.C.'s only economic immigration tool, the BC PNP addresses labour market demands and promotes economic growth in communities and industry sectors across the province. Along with issuing targeted invitations to candidates who provide high economic impact, the program’s immigration streams help address labour shortages in high-demand sectors; streams that are designed to attract and retain individuals who can fill critical gaps and support government priorities.

To learn more about the BC PNP's initiatives and how it contributes to B.C.’s economic development needs, see the topics below:
