# Nova Scotia

It was introduced to help address **economic and labour market needs** through immigration to the province.

Immigration to Nova Scotia has **tripled over the last 20 years** because of the introduction and continuous development of the NSNP, as well as the **Atlantic Immigration Pilot (AIP)** launched in 2017.

Nova Scotia now welcomes **over 7,000 new immigrants every year**.

The province has a **retention rate of over 70%**. This improvement is due to the NSNP and AIP focusing on **matching newcomers with job opportunities**. Both programs also help international graduates and temporary workers **transition to permanent residence**.

## Nova Scotia Immigration Streams

Nova Scotia has **enhanced streams** and **base streams**.  
The following are **enhanced**:

- **Nova Scotia Experience: Express Entry**  
- **Nova Scotia Labour Market Priorities**  
- **Nova Scotia Labour Market Priorities for Physicians**

**Enhanced** means that the sub-category is **aligned with the Express Entry system**.  
The federal government uses Express Entry to manage permanent residence applications through Canada’s main economic immigration programs.

Candidates in Express Entry receive a **Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)** score. Canada regularly holds Express Entry draws, where the **highest-ranking candidates** are invited to apply for permanent residence.

If you receive a **provincial nomination** from an enhanced program, you gain **600 additional CRS points**, which **guarantees an Invitation to Apply (ITA)** for permanent residence. Your nomination is issued directly through your Express Entry profile.

The majority of Nova Scotia’s immigration streams are **base streams**, meaning they are **not aligned with Express Entry**.  
Candidates who receive a provincial nomination must apply **directly to IRCC** (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada).

For many NSNP streams, you must meet the **minimum language requirements** according to the **Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB)** — a scale from 1 to 12 measuring language ability.
