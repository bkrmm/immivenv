**How the Farm Investor Pathway works**:

Farm Investor Pathway candidates must conduct a Farm Research Visit in Manitoba no more than one year before beginning the process.

The next step is to complete the Interest Guidelines (self-assessment of their situation) and the Farm Business Concept forms, and then submit them. You must also submit the Code of Conduct for Immigration Representatives if you need one.

If you receive an LAA, you can submit an application for the Farm Investor Pathway. You may be invited to an interview with an MPNP representative.

If approved, you will receive a Deposit Agreement (contract) which you must sign and send a deposit of CAD $75,000. Once you receive your nomination, you can apply directly to the Canadian federal government for permanent residence.  

**How the Entrepreneur Pathway works:**
First, determine whether or not you are eligible.
You should then research the business concept, explore Manitoba, and prepare the Business Concept Form.
The next step is to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) as well as your Business Concept Form, your Self-Assessment Form and a Code of Conduct for Immigration Representatives (if needed).
If you meet the minimum criteria and your Business Concept is approved, you will receive an official Letter of Advice to Apply (LAA).
You must then submit a complete application to the MPNP. You may be invited for an in-person interview.
If your application is successful, you will be asked to sign a Business Performance Agreement (BPA). This is a contractual agreement between you and the MPNP.
After that, you must come to Manitoba, operate your business and provide regular updates on the business’s performance.
Once you meet the terms and conditions of the BPA, you will obtain a provincial nomination for permanent residence.
You can then use this nomination to make another application directly to the Canadian federal government for permanent residency visas for you and your family.
